# Apples To Apples
Group project: https://github.com/mtriantafellu/Project-2
Recreation of the Apples To Apples card game.  Deployed at: http://ap2ap.herokuapp.com

## Getting Started
* Players and games are hard-coded into this version of the game.
* To play with default players and games, go to: http://ap2ap.herokuapp.com.  (Alternatively, clone, modify, and host the repository for yourself and modify the game.js file as needed...)
* Join one of the games.  EACH PLAYER must log in and play their turn for the game to advance.  It's just like playing with real cards!
* __Password does not matter.  Ignore/omit/type whatever you want.__
* __Player name__ and __game name__ are CASE SENSITIVE.  Include the spaces (Matt B, Matt T, game1, etc...)
* __All players except the judge:__ Look at the adjective, and pick a noun to go with it.  Try to appeal to the judge.
* __Judge:__ Choose which noun card you like best.  Whoever played the card wins the round.  You don't know who played which card. _(Cards are shuffled before they are revealed)_
* Players automatically take turns being the judge.
* Game eventually crashes when the cards run out.  There are enough cards for more than a dozen turns, but the Heroku server restarts autmotically every day.  __(Go outside or clone the repo to restart your games manually.)__

## This repository will not be upgraded.
This repository is primarily for coding practice and demonstration of technical skills.  Serious upgrades and promotion would run afoul of fair use of copyrighted material.  At best, I could make a different card game or theme using the same code.
Features such as a game lobby, invite/accept/decline, end/start game, Google/Facebook account login management, etc. will not be added to this game.
